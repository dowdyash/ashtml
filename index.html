	    				<p>
	    					I am Dr. Ashley Dowdy and I've spent the last seven years of my life working on a PhD in educational technology. I got the degree, but as you may know the job market is tough. Instead of waiting around for the right job, I decided to make one. Right now I teaching myself how to become a web developer with the help of <a href="https://skillcrush.com" target="_blank">Skillcrush</a>, but I am so much more.

	    					For the last few years, I have become a technology trainer for anyone who is ready to learn more about their personal technology. I also consult on technology purchases, making sure the technology fits with in your life. When I'm not training or consulting, I am a storyteller and mental health advocate that writes at <a href="https://medium.com/@dowdy" target="_blank"> Medium</a>.

	        			<h3>Training</h3>
	        			<p>
	        				I provide personalized one-on-one training tailored to meet clients' needs. From computer and smartphone basics to website design and everything in between.

	        			<p>
	        				The goal is to help my client find the best product for their lives. It is about the right tech at the right time. I want you to empower you with information so that you feel comfortable with the decisions you will be making. I love technology and want you to as well.

	        			<h3>Web Dev</h3>
	        			<p>
	        				My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible. I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.

	        			<h3>Writing</h3>
	        			<p>
	        				I am a storyteller, humorist, and mental health advocate. I write stories and share lived experiences with a twist of humor. From time to time technology finds its way in. It is all about sharing information and having a good time doing so.
